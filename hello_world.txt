I am proud of myself! for having come this far in this web development course.
Who would have thought I could do this remotely with less supervision? But to 
GOD be glory now and always.
I have always wanted to do but I had little self-motivation to pursue it. But, 
I promise myself, now that I have come this far, I will commit to it as much
as possible.
GOD be my Helper!
